                RACHEL<br>
                Andy and Janelle just got back from Paris.<br><br>
                JANELLE <br>
                Six and half hours on a plane with a baby. Won’t be doing that again soon! But it was heaven. <br><br>
                ANDY (to Frances)<br>
                Do you ever get to Paris?<br><br>
                FRANCES <br>
                Not really. No. Kind of once. Actually, no. What’s that museum with the escalators in tubes? <br><br>
                ANDY <br>
                The Pompidou. <br><br>

                FRANCES <br>
                Yeah! (beat) Um, do you get there? <br><br>
                RACHEL <br>
                They have a great place in the 6th. <br><br>
                ANDY <br>
                It’s a little pied a terre. <br><br>
            </div>
            <div class="toggle" data-type="group3">
                FRANCES<br>
                Literally! <br><br>
                ANDY <br>
                --but it’s a really special place. <br><br>
                JANELLE<br>
                It’s just been so hard to spend any time there since I got the job at the Journal. (beat) And the baby. <br><br>
                FRANCES <br>
                I’d love to go to Paris. I’ll bet it’s magic. One of my friends from college, Abby, who moved there because her boyfriend works for a bank. In school, she was on of the top five friends, but then Zoe became closer to our friend group and Abby kind of moved to the outer ring.<br><br>
            </div>
            <div class="toggle" data-type="group4">
                Everyone at the table listens politely. Rachel could give two shits. <br><br>    
                FRANCES<br>
                Sophie and Abby never totally got along. She started dating Luke who I always thought would have dated any of us, but he ended up with Abby. <br><br>
                Silence. <br><br>
                ANDY<br>
                Well, let me know if you’re ever there, we like for it to be used. <br><br>
                FRANCES<br>
                Oh okay...I don’t see myself probably getting there super soon, but...thanks, thanks.
